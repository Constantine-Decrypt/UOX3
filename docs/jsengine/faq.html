<h4><i>What language is the Script Engine using?</i></h4>
<p>The Script Engine is a JavaScript 1.5 compliant engine.  It's much the same as the JavaScript you might use on web pages, but without predefined web objects :)

<h4><i>When will the Script Engine be released?</i></h4>
<p>At the moment, we're aiming for a 3-4 week time frame.  The current date is January 31st, so it should definitely be available end of February.

<h4><i>What happens to my old scripts?</i></h4>
<p>The speech.scp and trigger scripts will be useless to you.  They will no longer be supported at all.  However, the documentation was released weeks in advance so that you can familiarize yourself with the system, and begin the transition.  Most triggers will be almost trivial to replace.  Over the coming weeks up to release, more and more documentation will become available to help you understand how it fits in, and how to translate between the two.

<h4><i>Where can I find the latest documentation for the Script Engine?</i></h4>
<p><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/uox3/uox3_new/documentation/jsengine/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/uox3/uox3_new/documentation/jsengine/</a>

<h4><i>Will there be a script repository, for example type purposes?</i></h4>
<p>Yes, there will be.  Example scripts will be on the documentation site, and hopefully sites such as <a href="http://www.uoxdev.com">www.uoxdev.com</a> will hold script repositories too.

<h4><i>I have suggestions for further events/functions/uses.  Who do I contact?</i></h4>
<p>You can post any ideas you have on the feature request page at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/uox3">the UOX3 sourceforge page</a>.  Also, you can email Abaddon here at <a href="mailto:darkangelab@users.sourceforge.net">darkangelab@users.sourceforge.net</a>.
